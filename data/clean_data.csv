"I recently read a comment on an article about setting yourself up for a successful interview from a woman who identified herself as a hiring manager. She expressed that something rather insignificant that she pays attention to during the interview is a **female** candidate's fingernails.

Not just if she fidgets or picks at the polish, but the shape and the color and how well kept her nails are. She however did not answer when another commentor asked her if it influenced her hiring decisions or if she gave the same level of scrutiny to men.

It got me thinking about how much I pay attention to my own fingernails. I am aware that my fingernails are in general an outward sign of how anxious I am. They are always clean, but I sometimes bite them or pick at them when I am feeling on edge. Now I am wondering how judged other people feel about their nails in professional and casual settings.

While we understand that you all have terrible self-esteem and don't think you'll ever get laid/will never find a partner/insert any other delusional self-hating fantasy here, but honestly this sub is not the place for your pity party.  Posting that crap is obviously attention-seeking behavior and we're not here to encourage it any more.  So we've decided to start handing out temp bans for anyone who wants to turn this sub into their own pity party.  This is applicable for both posts and comments.  

For example, these comments in response to the post ""What does your ideal SO look like"":

&gt; She exists

LMAO WE GET IT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO LONELY AN EXISTENT GIRLFRIEND IS SUFFICIENT ROFLMAO

&gt; my hand

HOLY SHIT WHAT A FUCKING COMEDIAN HERE PROEJCTING YOUR OWN INSECURITIES ONTO THIS POST SO ORIGINAL

&gt; literally anybody

OMFG WAOW SO TORTURED AND LONELY TAKE ME NOW RANDOM COMMENTER

Look everyone has their own insecurities and joking about them is fine but if the only thing you are going to offer to a post is non-answers specifically designed to make people feel bad because you are lacking in some way, then not only are you not contributing to the conversation, you're trying to push your own agenda of seeking validation.  Which is against the rules.

First offense: 3 day ban

Second offense: 7 day ban

Third offense: perma ban

And for those of you who were wondering ""why couldn't the mods have just implemented this and not told anyone about it"", it's because we need attention and want you all to notice us.

"Sup shitlords,

So the ~~idiots~~ fine individuals on the admin team have decided to enable community awards on our subreddit.  For those of you who don't know what that means, now you can give a post or comment an askmen-specific award because you just really love throwing your money away for a couple of pixels on a screen.  If you want to check out the options we have right now, just click on the ""give award"" link, or you can be lazy and click [here](https://imgur.com/a/n9Smsyh) and see the initial four we have enabled.  We may enable more depending on whether or not we feel like it.  Please feel free to try them out!

And now for some questions that will help me explain the use of these random pictures:

**Q: What is different between community awards and regular awards?**

A: Community awards are custom to the subreddit, and a portion of the money spent goes back to the subreddit in the form of a coin pool.  That pool can be used by the moderators to give out special awards (basically reddit platinum) to users who are good little boys and girls.  If you're lucky, you'll get one and it looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/0ZqeuZK).  

**Q: So basically the mods are getting reddit coins to use at their leisure?**

A: Yeah, pretty much.  But it can literally only be used to give awards to users.  

**Q: This sounds like a scam racket.  What's stopping you from only giving the awards to other moderators and using the community as an endless supply of reddit platinum for yourselves?**

A: Nothing.  But we won't do that because none of us care about reddit platinum enough to actually abuse this system like that.  Also the admins would probably get mad at us if we do that.  And we need the admins to do stuff every now and then so getting on their bad side seems like a bad idea.

**tl;dr we did a thing and now you can give out custom awards on the subreddit.  go nuts.**

"What I'm already doing:

1. Meal prepping his meals for work. I make sure he has two different options for meals throughout his work week so he doesn't get bored. Two cups vegetables, one cup protein, one cup legumes.

2. Nights he's home (he works 7 days out of state, off 7 days and comes home for those days) I cook dinner, kind of. He has salad with no dressing and I cook fish for him. The fish varies but it's usually mahi mahi or salmon. I season it and sometimes make a small amount of glaze for the fish but mostly to make the salad less dry. 

3. I make myself available to hang out with his son while he goes to the gym. No gyms in our area allows kids under 16 so that has been an issue.

4. Just be generally encouraging. I read books and find recipes and listen to podcasts. I listen to him talk about everything and encourage everything.

5. Healthy snacks in the house when he's home. If I indulge it's during the seven days he's at work. We do have one ice cream night a month, though. Together. As a family.

He goes to the gym two to three times a day when he's home. He intermittent fasts so he only eats from 2 pm to 10 pm. He's lost about 30 pounds so far. 

He's at a point where he needs to start cutting. He wants to have more definition. I'm just looking for ways I can help him further. Any advice would be great! Thank you!

Another edit: he's a former pro athlete who had acl surgery and got up to 230. His knee is all healed and he just wants to get back to ""fighting"" weight. He hasn't felt good since gaining weight.

It seems like a substantial number of girls I've dated recently make negative generalizations about men.

Most leaders should be women."", ""women are better at handling stress than men"", etc.).

My general reaction to this is to take it personally (ie the girl includes me in the ""men"" she is discussing), view it as a sign that she probably has a more negative view of men across the board and take it as a deal breaker. I don't go out with these girls again.

My friend thinks my dates are implicitly saying this applies to all men except me, the girls do not think negatively about men as a group and this should not be a deal breaker.

"So whenever I’m attracted to someone, usually someone I’m friends with, and we are close enough to the point where I can bring up if I’m on my period in context and it’s not tmi (or rather I can say ‘sorry if this is tmi’) I find it very attractive if the other person is kind and compassionate and acknowledges the fact that I’m going through it. 

For instance guys can be sweethearts and they say stuff like “aw if I was there I’d get you ice cream” or they’d like to cuddle etc and that’s very attractive and sets them aside form other guys because they care about you, about what you’re going through about how you’re feeling and your needs etc. They don’t just care about you when you’re dressed up and in makeup but also when you don’t feel your best or feel sucky and that’s the true bond of closeness. 

On the flip side a guy that I like (he’s probably just immature) stated once that guys generally don’t like talking about periods and stuff after I brought it up and I was like um wtf sorrry for annoying you with the fact that I’m on my period. Also I could mention something about me being on my period in context to something else and he’ll respond to the something else but in actuality I want him to acknowledge that im on my period and I’m vulnerable etc.

Is there something inherently feminine about being on your period? Because the media, and just society in general treats it like some kind of plague when in reality it’s kind of intimate and when a guy connects with you and is receptive and caring about you at a point when you’re so vulnerable it creates a new level of intimacy. 

It almost feels wrong to feel this way because of how much negative light is shed on periods. As in I feel like I “shouldn’t” feel this way and keep it to myself and that I should feel this is “weird” and not something to mention etc you know?

&amp;#x200B;

Last Monday, this new girl started her job at our workplace. To me she's a type of pretty like I've never seen before, as corny as that may sound. I walked up to her and introduced myself, didn't really speak besides that. The same evening I stumbled upon her on Instagram and decided to follow her. She followed back minutes later and we chatted a bit. Few hours later I decided to ask for her number, which she then gave to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then, we've been talking off and on and I don't know if it's normal but I kinda feel like I'm falling for her - like really hard. I didn't feel like torturing myself by keeping it to myself, so as impulsive as I am I messaged her Friday morning, saying I couldn't get her out of my head the entire week, that I think she's beautiful and I kinda like her. She replied and said she thinks I'm really sweet, but claims to have never been in love before because she's ''complicated'' so the interest isn't mutual.

&amp;#x200B;

I really feel like an idiot now, and I'm pretty sure I never should've told her. She says she doesn't mind me telling her so quickly but surely I come across as a major creep. She's way out of my league in terms of looks anyway, I'm like a 6/10 and she's fucking gorgeous. I'm not sure how to go around this.

"Doesn't matter if it's work. Or friends. Or girls I'm dating. I always care so much about the outcome.

I want to do good at work and thrive and sometimes things are out of control and I feel bad anyways.

Friends doesn't respond or act in a very nice way to me. I feel bad even though I'm not the responsible source for their bad behavior. 

Girls I'm dating who acts badly after a few weeks or start playing games. Hurt me. Even though I know they're the crazy ones and not me. Yet I take responsibility and blame. 


And I know most of things around me are not because of me. People have their own shit that they project on to you. 

Like, I can't control peoples thoughts. Why do I get so hung up on that?    Negative emotions always stay in my body and I can't focus on anything else than the thing that messes me up.

Right now.  There's a girl I know have no interest in me. She used to have.  Now I'm just pissed of about how things could have been better if xyz happened.   I know it's ridiculous. I know I can't do anything about it.  I know for a fact I'm the better person after getting to know her more.  Yet I feel bad. Why.

Why do I keep getting stuck on things that make me feel bad when I want to move on?

I listen to positive things everyday.  I do affirmations.  And I try to always view things positively since I'm not God and doesn't control whats happening around me . (don't believe in God either but that's not important)

How can I learn to be in control of what I feel and stop being so invested in things? If I don't care I get cold and douchey. And I don't want that either

"So recently i’ve been talking to two girls at the same time. 

I met one off of tinder back in like february, went on one date, fizzled off and then we started talking about a week ago. We then went on a movie date and have been texting back and forth. Nothing’s happened so far and its hard to tell if we have good chemistry because she’s sort of reserved. We both said we like each other but have yet to act on it. I’m not sure if I entirely want a serious longterm relationship with her, sort of more of a summer fling thing if we were to go out. Which I plan on talking to her on our next date if I don’t break it off just yet. 

I met the other girl at a bar about 2 weeks ago, and have been talking since then too. We have a ton in common, way more than the other girl off of tinder and get along great. Mind you we had great chemistry while at the bar dancing. But she just got out of a serious relationship and I’ve been trying to get her to go out on a date with me but she’s nervous about it. If this wasn’t an issue, I definitely would’ve already gone on a date with her but she keeps putting it off. If we were to go out, I would be more open to a long term relationship. But because it’s so up in the air, i’m not sure if I should jeopardize the other possible relationship with the other girl just to pursue bar girl. 

I feel bad/shitty talking to two girls at a time but I’m not sure since it’s still on a go with the flow basis. I’m just stumped at what to do.

"I'm going to try to keep this as short as I can.  TLDR at the bottom. 

My husband got out of the marines in early 2016, and shortly after enlisted in the USAF reserves. Through schooling and opportunities he has been able to be active reserves and we live on base. Throughout our relationship &amp; marriage we lost a son at birth (we knew it was coming, he didn't develop kidneys) and twins in utero at 12 weeks. We've yet to carry any children successfully and I know this bothers him. I am currently pregnant but without answers from our other losses, the pregnancy is stressful for us both, especially him. He  is my rock and has always listened when I need him to and taken care of me when I was down or sick. He to help himself threw himself into work and only broke down once in front of me. 

3 months ago we got into an accident on base and my husband got into an altercation while in uniform with the service member who hit us. It wasn't a bad accident, fender bender. His over-reaction caused him to get a Letter of Reprimand which was honestly a slap on the wrist to what he could've gotten. Due to this incident he has been labeled unsafe in the work environment and unpredictable but is still allowed to keep his job. These labels really bother him though. This is the opposite of the man I know, he is level headed and doesn't engage in arguments unless absolutely necessary, he is one of the least emotional men I know. I do know in moments of extreme anger he has gotten mildly physical with his mother before - this was after a solid week of her berating me for not doing something she hadn't told me to do. It was not his proudest moment but he put his hand over her mouth and told he to ""shut the fuck up"", promptly after he apologized and left. (We've discussed that I will leave at the first signs of physical violence towards me so my safety is a non-issue.) He has since made up with his mother and she says it was her fault, she pressed him too hard. I remain neutral to it. 

Per his LOR he is required to see a psychologist and he has been opening up to me a lot since then. He told me a few minutes ago there are times he wishes he just wouldn't wake up, he feels like a burden on everyone. I asked how long he's felt this way and he told me on and off since he left the Marines in 2016. I'm at a loss because he's always been my rock and hasn't shown signs of depression but that doesn't matter. I want to help him. 

What can I do to help him at home? I'm always a listening ear, he rarely opens up but I'd like to encourage that. Any advice helps, thank you.

I’m not tryna get hurt this early into our talking stage. He invites me to hang out with his siblings, his friends, and his roommates. He always asks me to sleepover (even if we don’t hook up) and always is begging me to stay longer and not go home. But the second I’m not with him, he sucks at texting/communicating... literally not texting me first for days, could be a week at least before I hear from him next. But when we make plans to see each other it’s fireworks all over again, and we are in the honeymoon stage again..... until I leave and then again to the radio silence. I don’t know if he’s keeping his distance sometimes because he’s talking to other girls or if he’s worried I’m playing him. I’ve never had to be the one pursing the guy, so I don’t know if he wants me to chase him or if he’s playing me. He’s told me once while drunk that he wants me to show that I want him more.

I know that there are benefits I could get from working out, even from home. I just find it mind-numbingly boring. Sure, the first week you feel muscle soreness and it's cool and all. But then after that it sucks ass. Do pullups for a bit. Okay now Squats. Time for some bench press. It's boring. 

Then there are the Youtubers talking fitness who basically commited their lives to working out(budgetting for food, planning their days, spending time). It just makes me feel like everything that I could do is pointless. Also, it seems like their goals are at odds to mine. I don't want to be jacked, ripped or whatever. I just want to be healthier. I hate it when a friend of mine and I need to carry stuff and they are clearly lifting it higher and in not as much pain as me.

I enjoy walks, cause I can unwind and stuff, but doesn't entirly cut it either. Cause my entire upper body is neglected.

As for sports, I don't have too many friends into sports. Plus, I am very insecure about sports as not only do I suck at them, but I was bullied over being bad at them my entire life.

Not sure how it happened but one day a few years later while I was at a bar I thought to myself ‘man I really actually fancy a beer’. Ordered one and somehow loved it but have no idea how I just sort of came around to it after hating it before, and now it’s mostly all I drink when I’m out.

"We got sexual fast and I’m ok with that but he only plans dates via text. In person he’s really respectful and gives me his full attention. We’ve bonded over things and it’s going well, but im a person of habitually texting often. Texting about how my day is going is not hard.

He ignores some of my texts, like ones that are pictures and little comments that reminded me of our inside jokes. Or even how work is going for him. He doesn’t reply to that and then I’ll start doubting his intentions but then he’ll send me a pic of him and his nephew and I’m so confused!!! 

I like him in person but texting is getting frustrating. Am I overthinking this and need to cool down or do I have some validity?! 

I might also add he’s an introvert but has an extrovert side. He started off texting me good morning texts and being really available and after the first date he’s really backed off texting wise. But again, he’ll send really sweet things like pics of him and his nephew, so idk why he would do that if he was in it just for the sex. (Might I add we met online).

Edit: my friends say to give him some time but I already have abandonment issues and my feelings have been all over the place with him and his texting style in between dates.

"I (woman) asked a guy out for a date next week, but it occurred to me that even though we were flirting, he might just think I meant to hang out and not go on a date. Wording of the convo went something like this (over text)

me: good seeing you tonight!

him: you too! hope to see you sooner than 6 months from now

me: well then maybe we should plan something

And now plans have ensued, but I'm nervous because I didn't explicitly say ""date."" I think this nervousness comes from the last date I went on a few months ago, where I asked the guy out after a night of flirting and he enthusiastically agreed, we met up that weekend, and he couldn't have been less interested in me (I'm talking like, the only time we touched in the four hours was when we high-fived) and I didn't know if it was because sometime during the week he decided he hated me and wanted to waste both of our times, or if I was under the wrong impression and we were just hanging out as friends.

I guess I'll be able to tell hopefully when we actually meet up, but I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable by assuming we're on a date when its not. It's probably psycho to text him ""JUST SO YOU KNOW, THIS IS A DATE,"" right?
